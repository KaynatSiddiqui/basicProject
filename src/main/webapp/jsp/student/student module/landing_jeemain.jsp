    <p class="text-justify">
    The Department of Higher Education, Ministry of Human Resource Development (now known as Ministry of Education), Government of India has entrusted the responsibility of conducting Joint Entrance Examination JEE (Main) to the NTA from 2019 onwards.
    </p>
    <p class="text-justify">
    The Joint Entrance Examination (JEE Main) comprises of two papers. The Paper1 is conducted for admission to Undergraduate Engineering Programs (B.E/B. Tech) at NITs, IIITs, other Centrally Funded Technical Institutions (CFTIs), Institutions/Universities funded/recognized by participating State Governments, as well as an eligibility test for JEE (Advanced), which is conducted for admission to IITs.
    </p>
    <p class="text-justify">The JEE (Main) is being conducted in multiple Sessions (February/March/April/May 2021) for admissions in the next academic session. The candidates will thus benefit in the following ways:</p>
  <p class="text-justify ml-5">- This will give multiple opportunities to the candidates to improve their scores in the examination if they fail to give their best in the first attempt without wasting their whole academic year.</p>
 
 <p class="text-justify ml-5">- In first attempt, the students will get a first-hand experience of taking an examination and will know their mistakes which they can improve while attempting for the next time.</p>
	
	<p class="text-justify ml-5">- This will reduce the chances of dropping a year and droppers would not have to waste a full year.</p>
	<p class="text-justify ml-5">- If anyone missed the examination due to reasons beyond control, then he/she will not have to wait for one full year.</p> 
	<p class="text-justify ml-5">- A candidate need not appear in all the four Sessions. However, if candidate appears in more than one Session then his/her best of the 2021 NTA Scores will be considered for preparation of Merit List/ Ranking.</p>
